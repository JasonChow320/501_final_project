FitGen is a wardrobe management app for Android. Users can sign up and from there can manage multiple profiles within their account. When they log in to their desired profile, the user should start by adding clothes to their wardrobe. Once added, they can view all of their clothes by selecting "View Wardrobe" in our main menu. They can generate and save outfits using the clothes in their wardrobe. Finally we have a settings page to allow users to change their temperature thresholds for generating outfits with 1, 2, or 3 top layers. They can adjust their camera flash settings, enable/disable caching (which allows us to download their database images locally to load faster) and finally they can toggle the theme and language. Learn more about the inner workings of FitGen by checking out our [Final Presentation]().
